# ComfyUI-Based Image Generation

This folder contains scripts for generating synthetic demographic images
using the ComfyUI diffusion workflow. These images were used for testing
bias behavior in Vision-Language Models.

## Files

- `demographic_comfy_image.py`
- `generate_comfy_image.py`

⚠️ Note: Generated images are NOT included in the repository to keep the
repo lightweight and avoid storing large media files.

## Usage
1. Install ComfyUI
2. Run the scripts to generate images
3. Output images are saved locally to your chosen directory

For detailed documentation of prompts and experimental settings, refer to the main thesis report.
